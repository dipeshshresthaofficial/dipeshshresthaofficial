## A brief description about myself:
A dedicated and results-oriented software engineer with a passion for creating innovative solutions. 
With around 3 years of professional experience in software development and database management, my expertise lies in the realm of web and mobile application development, API development, business analysis, and testing. Throughout my journey, I have diligently honed my skills in a wide range of technologies and frameworks, including JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, Express.js, Java, Spring Boot, Python, MySQL, MongoDB, SAP BusinessObjects, Tableau, Cerner CCL, and Microsoft Azure. These robust foundations have equipped me with the knowledge and versatility necessary to tackle diverse projects and deliver efficient and scalable solutions.

During my career, I have had the opportunity to work on projects involving important concepts like object-oriented design patterns, asynchronous request handling, user authentication and authorization, global state management, REST APIs and optimized database queries. My experience includes collaborating closely with healthcare clients while working at Oracle Cerner, a leading Healthcare IT company, where I gained valuable insights into the US healthcare industry and developed a strong understanding of client requirements.

As a computer science student, I have always been passionate about developing software solutions and applying logic to interact with databases. I thrive in collaborative team environments and possess excellent problem-solving and communication skills. My ability to work independently and take ownership of projects has allowed me to contribute effectively to teams and deliver successful results.

I am constantly seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends. I am excited to leverage my technical expertise and contribute to meaningful projects that make a positive impact on society.
